# ID-based RAG FastAPI

## Overview
This project integrates Langchain with FastAPI in an Asynchronous, Scalable manner, providing a framework for document indexing and retrieval, using PostgreSQL/pgvector.

Files are organized into embeddings by `file_id`. The primary use case is for integration with [LibreChat](https://librechat.ai), but this simple API can be used for any ID-based use case.

The main reason to use the ID approach is to work with embeddings on a file-level. This makes for targeted queries when combined with file metadata stored in a database, such as is done by LibreChat.

The API will evolve over time to employ different querying/re-ranking methods, embedding models, and vector stores.

## Features
- **Document Management**: Methods for adding, retrieving, and deleting documents.
- **Vector Store**: Utilizes Langchain's vector store for efficient document retrieval.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Offers async operations for enhanced performance.

## Setup

### Getting Started

- **Configure `.env` file based on [section below](#environment-variables)**
- **Setup pgvector database:**
  - Run an existing PSQL/PGVector setup, or,
  - Docker: `docker compose up` (also starts RAG API)
    - or, use docker just for DB: `docker compose -f ./db-compose.yaml up`
- **Run API**:
  - Docker: `docker compose up` (also starts PSQL/pgvector)
    - or, use docker just for RAG API: `docker compose -f ./api-compose.yaml up`
  - Local:
    - Make sure to setup `DB_HOST` to the correct database hostname
    - Run the following commands (preferably in a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/))
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app
```

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required to run the application:

- `RAG_OPENAI_API_KEY`: The API key for OpenAI API Embeddings (if using default settings).
    - Note: `OPENAI_API_KEY` will work but `RAG_OPENAI_API_KEY` will override it in order to not conflict with LibreChat setting.
- `RAG_OPENAI_BASEURL`: (Optional) The base URL for your OpenAI API Embeddings
- `RAG_OPENAI_PROXY`: (Optional) Proxy for OpenAI API Embeddings
- `VECTOR_DB_TYPE`: (Optional) select vector database type, default to `pgvector`.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: (Optional) The name of the PostgreSQL database, used when `VECTOR_DB_TYPE=pgvector`.

- `PDF_EXTRACT_IMAGES`: (Optional) A boolean value indicating whether to extract images from PDF files. Default value is "False".
- `DEBUG_RAG_API`: (Optional) Set to "True" to show more verbose logging output in the server console, and to enable postgresql database routes
- `CONSOLE_JSON`: (Optional) Set to "True" to log as json for Cloud Logging aggregations
- `EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER`: (Optional) either "openai", "azure", "huggingface", "huggingfacetei" or "ollama", where "huggingface" uses sentence_transformers; defaults to "openai"
- `EMBEDDINGS_MODEL`: (Optional) Set a valid embeddings model to use from the configured provider.
    - **Defaults**
    - openai: "text-embedding-3-small"
    - azure: "text-embedding-3-small" (will be used as your Azure Deployment)
    - huggingface: "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
    - huggingfacetei: "http://huggingfacetei:3000". Hugging Face TEI uses model defined on TEI service launch.
    - ollama: "nomic-embed-text"
- `RAG_AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`: (Optional) Default is `2023-05-15`. The version of the Azure OpenAI API.
- `RAG_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: (Optional) The API key for Azure OpenAI service.
    - Note: `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` will work but `RAG_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` will override it in order to not conflict with LibreChat setting.
- `RAG_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: (Optional) The endpoint URL for Azure OpenAI service, including the resource.
    - Example: `https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com`.
    - Note: `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` will work but `RAG_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` will override it in order to not conflict with LibreChat setting.
- `HF_TOKEN`: (Optional) if needed for `huggingface` option.
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: (Optional) defaults to `http://ollama:11434`.

Make sure to set these environment variables before running the application. You can set them in a `.env` file or as system environment variables.

### Use Atlas MongoDB as Vector Database

Instead of using the default pgvector, we could use [Atlas MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search) as the vector database. To do so, set the following environment variables

```env
VECTOR_DB_TYPE=atlas-mongo
ATLAS_MONGO_DB_URI=<mongodb+srv://...>
MONGO_VECTOR_COLLECTION=<collection name>
```

The `ATLAS_MONGO_DB_URI` could be the same or different from what is used by LibreChat. Even if it is the same, the `$MONGO_VECTOR_COLLECTION` collection needs to be a completely new one, separate from all collections used by LibreChat. In additional,  create a vector search index for  `$MONGO_VECTOR_COLLECTION`  with the following json:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "numDimensions": 1536,
      "path": "embedding",
      "similarity": "cosine",
      "type": "vector"
    },
    {
      "path": "file_id",
      "type": "filter"
    }
  ]
}
```

Follw one of the [four documented methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/create-index/#procedure) to create the vector index.


### Cloud Installation Settings:

#### AWS:
Make sure your RDS Postgres instance adheres to this requirement:

`The pgvector extension version 0.5.0 is available on database instances in Amazon RDS running PostgreSQL 15.4-R2 and higher, 14.9-R2 and higher, 13.12-R2 and higher, and 12.16-R2 and higher in all applicable AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.`

In order to setup RDS Postgres with RAG API, you can follow these steps:

* Create a RDS Instance/Cluster using the provided [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.html).
* Login to the RDS Cluster using the Endpoint connection string from the RDS Console or from your IaC Solution output.
* The login is via the *Master User*.
* Create a dedicated database for rag_api:
``` create database rag_api;```.
* Create a dedicated user\role for that database:
``` create role rag;```

* Switch to the database you just created: ```\c rag_api```
* Enable the Vector extension: ```create extension vector;```
* Use the documentation provided above to set up the connection string to the RDS Postgres Instance\Cluster.

Notes:
  * Even though you're logging with a Master user, it doesn't have all the super user privileges, that's why we cannot use the command: ```create role x with superuser;```
  * If you do not enable the extension, rag_api service will throw an error that it cannot create the extension due to the note above.

### Dev notes:

#### Installing pre-commit formatter

Run the following commands to install pre-commit formatter, which uses [black](https://github.com/psf/black) code formatter:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
