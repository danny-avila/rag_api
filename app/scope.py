"""The one place a request's scope becomes a store predicate.

Files and their chunks are owner-scoped and carry raw content, so scope is
enforced structurally rather than remembered by each caller. Every route that
reads or removes stored content builds its predicate from :class:`ScopeFilter`.
Drift between hand-written scope clauses is the realistic failure mode; one
builder makes it impossible rather than merely reviewable.

The predicate is always ``(owner, file)`` and always goes into the store query
*before* ranking. Nothing downstream re-derives authorization from what the
store returned.
