"""Route-level proof that the read and delete paths carry the caller's scope.

The store double here is not a stub: it evaluates the predicate the route builds
against real rows, so what these tests exercise is the route wiring — that every
path passes a scope at all, and that the scope it passes is the token's rather
than the caller's. The SQL that implements the predicate is covered against a
real database in ``tests/integration/test_authorization_pg.py``.
